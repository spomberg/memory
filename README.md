## Overview

Memory is a responsive single-page site built with React. Users are able to:

- Play the Memory game either solo or multiplayer (up to 4 players)
- Set the theme to use numbers or icons within the tiles
- Choose to play on either a 6x6 or 4x4 grid- View the optimal layout for the interface depending on their device's screen size
- See hover and focus states for all interactive elements on the page

### The challenge

The challenge was to create the app based solely on the user stories above and the design files provided. I was free to use any framework and language I wished and no code was given to start with.

The image below is the provided preview of what the app was supposed to look like:
